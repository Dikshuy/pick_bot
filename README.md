# Flipkart Robotics Challenge-Intelligent Picking ( Team- Excalibur)
The problem statement tries to replicate the quintessential warehouse problem of picking in which the
participants are supposed to build their own robot hardware and software (collectively, a “Robot”) that is
capable of doing general tasks of picking items from a pick area and place them into a cell in th drop/stow
area.
